- With the `Reverse Imaging` we shall find that the place is `BudaPest`.
- We shall see the longest road along the water body.
- Go along the road and will find the place.
- So the first Image is [`Id. Antall József rkp., Budapest`](https://goo.gl/maps/yE7rSav4cdNgdFQM8) - `47.5049481,19.0448162`
- Rounding up to three decimals both gives, `47.504,19.045`.

## Image 2

- With the `Reverse Imaging` we shall find that the place is `Germany`.
- We shall see the `Palace` surrounded by `water` and a pathway with `frames` in it.
- So the second Image is [`Kreuzgang im Bauhausstil, Germany`](https://goo.gl/maps/J6kLBrtQVNQ6JnQr9) - `53°37'14.4"N 11°24'48.0"E`
- Rounding up to two decimals both gives, `53.62,11.41`.
