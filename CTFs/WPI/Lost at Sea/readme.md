- Download the `ZIP` file.
- Extract it and mount it in `Autopsy`.
- Recover songs from the `Recycle Bin`. 
- We shall understand that the original songs are [`Moby duck`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA7e_dxDOCo) - [`Running down to cuba`](https://youtu.be/J1P2XXDMfbY) - [`Wellerman`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHbU6s0jANc).
- Download original song. 
- Using audacity, invert recovered song and align with original. 
- The Song will be gone and you can hear flag.
- If all goes fine you will directly get the clear audio.
- In my case the refining was not proper and was able to hear partially.
- With that we have found the partial flag.
