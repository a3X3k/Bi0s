## SQLI Lab Challenges

### Challenge 1 --> GET Error Based Single Quotes String

- Input the Id as Parameter with numerical value.
- Use **\?variable name = value** after the URL.
- Here the variable name is **ID**.
- The value is any numerical value. **Eg : 1**
- Main Query is **Select * from TABLE where id='given_value';**
- With our input as 1 complete backend query will be 
```
SELECT * from table_name WHERE id=’1’ LIMIT 0,1
```

- With our input as 1’ complete backend query will be 
 ```
SELECT * from table_name WHERE id=’1’’ LIMIT 0,1
```
- which is syntactically incorrect and by giving input as, 

```
1’–+ (1 quote hyphen hyphen plus)
1’–%20 (%20 URL encoding for space)
1’%23 (%23 URL encoding for #)

--> %20 for. spaces  
--> %23 for. #
```

### Challenge 2 --> GET Error Based Integer Based

- Now we try to attack by putting in strings such as “abc“and “xyz” 
- We observe that for lesson 2 we receive an error from the database. 
- If we put id = 1' we again get an error in the Mysql server for incorrect syntax.  **You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ‘\’ LIMIT 0,1′ at line 1**
- Now the query which it changes to is

```
Select * from TABLE where id = 1’ ;
```
So we have an odd number of single quotes (‘), which breaks the query and takes it as an integer.

```
Select * from TABLE where id = (some integer value); ;
```

- To avoid such errors we can comment out the rest of the query.

**We inject the code with ?id=1′%20 --** 

( OR )

**We inject the code with ?id=1′%23 #** 

```
Select * from TABLE where id = 1’%20 -- ;

( OR )

Select * from TABLE where id = 1’%23 # ;
```
